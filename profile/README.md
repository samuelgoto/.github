## W3C Federated Identity Working Group

This GitHub repository will serve the [W3C Federated Identity Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/). 

The FedID WG works together with the [FedID CG](https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/) [repo](https://github.com/fedidcg/). 

* *FedCM*: [Repo](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM) [Draft spec](https://w3c-fedid.github.io/FedCM/)  transferred from the FedIDCG to this organization to continue its development here. Issues against the specification and proposed fixes (pull requests) should be added here.

A recharter has been proposed (13 August, 2024) to add the [WICG Digital Credentials API](https://github.com/WICG/digital-credentials). If that recharter passes, the Working Group will follow a similar process for that specification.
